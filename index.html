        <h3>Junoir Design Project</h3>
        <p>On November 19th, 2022, I participated in a team design competition. My team name was EGOW (an abbreviation
          of
          teammate names: Elijah, Godfred, Obi and Wesley) and our task was to design a device that allows
          organizations to safely lower items vertically as a response to workplace hazards of falling items.</p>
        <p>Given the limited resources and design constraints, team EGOW's final design was a makeshift pulley with a
          bucket container that managed to safely lower 5 eggs from a desk height to the ground</p>

      <div id="wordle-section">
        <h3>WORDLE Game</h3>
        <p>As a fun project, I programmed a compiler terminal version of the New York Times WORDLE game.
        WORDLE is a popular word game that takes 6 attempts to figure out what the 5-letter word is. Here's a video
          demonstrating how it works in a compiler terminal:</p>

        <h3>IEEE Xtreme</h3>
        <p>During the Fall 2022 semester, I had the privilege to participate in the IEEE Xtreme coding competition.In
          teams, the task was to complete as many real-world scenario code problems of varying complexity within 24
          hours.</p>
        <p>My Team, Team WES, placed 2000 / 7000 in Canada! Pretty good for the first time, right?! I plan to
          participate
          again next year with a bigger team (not just me, lol) and better preparation!</p>

      <div id="trafficSim-section">
        <h3>Traffic simulation</h3>
        <p>During the fall semester of my first year, I undertook a python coding project to build a simulation of
          Train crossing traffic. I built this simulation using various sensors and components from an Arduino Grove
          Kit, including a touch sensor, buttons and LEDs. In my code, I included libraries for Arduino functions that
          allow me to manipulate my input sensors and outputs.</p>
        <p> This was a fun and educative project that exhibited my creativity and passion for building technological
          solutions </p>
